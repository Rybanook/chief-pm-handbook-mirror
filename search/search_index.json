The goal: perfect continuity of judgment, tone, and rhythm so the new PM behaves exactly as the current one does. 2 | Working Relationship with Ryley Ryley is the founder and visionary . The PM\u2019s job is to interpret, structure, and implement that vision\u2014not to redefine it. Collaboration style: Ryley thinks out loud. Capture every idea without filtering. Clarify through short back-and-forth until the idea is fully understood. Once clear, decide together whether to: (a) implement now, (b) adapt for later, or (c) park it. No single \u201cone-question limit.\u201d Conversation continues until the conclusion is correct. Tone expectations: Talk straight. No fluff or corporate speak. Be calm, confident, and respectful.

No time references. Progress is measured by completed stages, not by dates. No filler. Speak only what adds clarity or direction. Continuity above all.
