It: Authenticates with real Google OAuth. Reads and syncs your actual Google Calendar. Generates a truthful narrative brief (spoken + visual). Works offline with pending action replay & Room DB truth. In v3.9, adds voice-first onboarding: a short calm intro, explicit consent for proactive speech, Quiet Hours, and profile confirmation\u2014persisted locally and on the backend. Core principle: earn trust through restraint and competence. The experience should make the user breathe easier. 2) How We Work Together (Non-Negotiable) One step at a time. One command per message. Wait for output, then proceed. Three Git Bash windows: [ANDROID], [BACKEND], [SERVER]. Prefix commands correctly. Direct, no fluff. One surgical clarifying question max when truly necessary. Confirm before next step. Verify outputs like Listening on :8080, BUILD SUCCESSFUL, etc. Never guess. Only act on verified facts. If you haven\u2019t seen a file, ask to open/show it. Do not rename/refactor established files unless explicitly instructed. Canadian context: default to CAD and America/Vancouver timezone where relevant. 3) Technical Architecture (High Level) Android (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose) App ID: app.chief.app Key packages / files (paths verified): app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/MainActivity.kt \u2014 app entry, brief playback, Google sign-in launcher, sync wiring. app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/network/: OauthApi.kt \u2014 canonical OAuth API client (see Appendix A). BriefApi.kt, ProfileApi.kt, SyncApi.kt, IntentApi.kt, IntentModels.kt, NetworkConfig.kt app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/data/db/ \u2014 Room entities/DAOs (EventEntity, PendingActionEntity, etc.) app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/sync/ \u2014 SyncPoller, SyncBus, PendingReplay app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/speech/ \u2014 CloudTtsEngine, TtsEngine, TtsManager app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/ui/brief/ \u2014 Visual panel, playback UI app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/data/settings/SettingsStore.kt \u2014 v3.9 foundation present app/src/main/res/raw/tick.wav \u2014 haptics/feedback SFX Offline truth via Room + Pending actions queue. Device ID (UUID) is sent as header x-user-id to backend. Backend (Node.js, Express, SQLite) Entry: server.cjs Routes: routes/auth.cjs \u2014 OAuth handlers (/auth/google/mobile-exchange, /auth/status, etc.) routes/profile.cjs \u2014 GET/POST /profile (extended in v3.9 to carry consent, quiet hours, voice) routes/intent.cjs \u2014 intent helpers (IMPORTANT: not the owner of /intent/confirm) Libraries / helpers: lib/dbAuth.cjs \u2014 SQLite instance. lib/dbProfile.cjs \u2014 Profile helpers. Now includes consent_proactive, quiet_hours_start, quiet_hours_end, preferred_voice_id. DB file: data/users_auth.db (this is the shared source-of-truth at this stage). 4) Current Progress (Verified Facts) Branching / tags Android: feature branch feat/v3.9-onboarding-consent created from master after merging feat/v3.9-prep-settings-foundation. Tag v3.9-foundation-merged pushed. Backend: feat/v3.9-onboarding-consent-backend created from feat/v3.8-oauth-truthful-brief-backend. OAuth on Android: OauthApi.kt exists and is canonical. Path: app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/network/OauthApi.kt This was restored from the v3.8 branch with: git checkout feat/v3.8-oauth-truthful-brief -- app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/network/OauthApi.kt Backend Profile route updated: routes/profile.cjs now reads/writes consent_proactive, quiet_hours_start, quiet_hours_end, preferred_voice_id via lib/dbProfile.cjs. Tested with curl \u2014 values persisted & retrieved. Android \u2194 Backend connectivity: adb reverse is required: adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080 App successfully reads brief & detects calendar diffs when connected. Logcat previously showed a failed connect before reverse; after reversing + server running \u2192 normal. Two-package issue resolved: Old app.chief.android uninstalled. Active package now: app.chief.app. 5) Phase v3.9 Scope & Guardrails (Locked) No new DB file. Continue using data/users_auth.db for identity/profile at this stage. First-launch trigger: Android decides onboarding based on local SettingsStore state right after OAuth success. (Backend may return \u201cprofile incomplete\u201d later; device remains authoritative for UX.) Voice preset: Reuse Bill Turbo; add onboarding SSML persona helper on backend (slightly warmer/slower) for first-contact lines. Worker directives already executed / to execute: Backend: Extend lib/dbProfile.cjs (done) and /profile route (done). Android: Use SettingsStore to decide onboarding when profile/consent not set (Settings foundation present; onboarding screens pending). Backend: Add onboarding persona helper in voicePersona.cjs (pending small addition). 6) \u201cTruth Table\u201d \u2014 Ownership & Naming (Do not deviate) Android OAuth client class: OauthApi (lowercase \u201ca\u201d) Path: app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/network/OauthApi.kt There is no 0AuthAPI.kt, ZeroAuthApi.kt, or ZeroOffAPI.kt in use now. Who owns /intent/confirm? server.cjs, not routes/intent.cjs. Intent router must not shadow or re-implement it. DB in use: data/users_auth.db (via lib/dbAuth.cjs). users_profile table extended; users_auth remains for OAuth tokens (as previously wired). 7) Features & Flow (User Perspective) Sign in with Google \u2192 sends serverAuthCode via /auth/google/mobile-exchange with header x-user-id (per-install UUID). Sync & Brief Backend fetches Google Calendar using stored refresh/access tokens. Android shows Brief Visual Panel and can speak narrative via TTS. Pending actions (add/move/delete) queue offline and replay when back online. Sync diff prompts allow accept/reject to reconcile local vs server truth; resolves via /sync/resolve. v3.9 Onboarding (to be completed next) On first launch post-OAuth: Chief speaks a short intro. Ask for proactive speech consent. Set Quiet Hours. Confirm profile (name/timezone/voice). Persist locally (SettingsStore) + backend /profile. 8) Code Conventions & Useful Commands Git (Android repo): Check branches: git branch -a Switch/create feature branch: git checkout -b feat/v3.9-onboarding-consent Merge with message (no-ff): git merge feat/v3.9-prep-settings-foundation --no-ff -m \"merge(v3.9): integrate settings foundation for onboarding base\" Tag + push: git tag -a v3.9-foundation-merged -m \"v3.9 \u2022 Settings foundation merged for onboarding base\" git push origin feat/v3.9-onboarding-consent --tags Build / install (Android): ./gradlew installDebug Run app (Android): Force-stop + start: \"/c/Users/User/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe\" shell am force-stop app.chief.app \"/c/Users/User/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe\" shell am start -S -n app.chief.app/.MainActivity Port reverse: \"/c/Users/User/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe\" reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080 Logcat filters (Android): \"/c/Users/User/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe\" logcat app.chief.app:D GoogleAuthHelper:D OAuthFlow:D *:S Backend (Node): [SERVER] node server.cjs Expect: [Chief TTS] Listening on http://localhost:8080 Confirm port: netstat -ano | findstr :8080 Profile curl samples (replace ) \u2014 see \u00a70 for full commands. 9) Outstanding Issues / Notes WAV/MP3 \u201coffline brief\u201d nuance: Offline playback uses cacheDir/offline_brief.mp3 if present; if missing, toast will show \u201cNo offline audio found\u201d. This is legacy from v3.8 testing\u2014harmless, but worth consolidating once v3.9 onboarding TTS lines are added. Logcat noise: Repeated Unable to open libpenguin.so messages (harmless). Live Sync toast observed: After reconnecting (post adb reverse), app displayed a toast about live sync returning\u2014expected when network transitions from offline \u2192 online; not a defect. SettingsStore present but onboarding UI not yet implemented: Foundation merged; screens/flows still to build. Minor deprecation in Compose (togetherWith) \u2014 seen in warnings; not blocking. 10) Immediate Next Steps (Linear, Do In Order) Backend \u2014 add onboarding persona helper File: lib/voicePersona.cjs Add a helper like buildOnboardingGreetingPersona(voiceId) that wraps Bill Turbo with slightly slower rate and warmer SSML. Keep API similar to existing persona builders, and do not change existing IDs. Android \u2014 implement onboarding UI flow (Compose) Read SettingsStore on app start/post-OAuth. If any of {consent, quiet_hours_start, quiet_hours_end} missing \u2192 launch onboarding screens. POST updates to /profile as user confirms each step; mirror to SettingsStore. Play intro line using existing TTS path. Android \u2014 MainActivity trigger After OAuth success (or when app resumes and getAuthStatus indicates tokens exist), check SettingsStore and route to onboarding if needed. QA pass Set consent true/false \u2192 ensure proactive voice respects value. Set Quiet Hours \u2192 ensure brief/pulse avoids speaking during those times unless explicitly requested. Tag & backup When onboarding works end-to-end: tag v3.9-onboarding-consent on both repos. 11) Continuity Guardrails (Paste-Ready for any new GPT) Do not rename OauthApi.kt. Path is fixed: app/chief/app/network/OauthApi.kt. Class: OauthApi. Do not move /intent/confirm out of server.cjs. The router must not duplicate it. Do not introduce a new DB file for profile; continue using data/users_auth.db. One command at a time with window prefixes [ANDROID], [BACKEND], [SERVER]. No multi-file edits unasked. Ask to see current file contents before proposing changes. Use adb reverse for device \u2194 localhost comms. All dates/times default to America/Vancouver unless otherwise stated. 12) Appendix A \u2014 Canonical OauthApi.kt (as used) package app.chief.app.network import okhttp3.MediaType.Companion.toMediaType import okhttp3.OkHttpClient import okhttp3.Request import okhttp3.RequestBody.Companion.toRequestBody import org.json.JSONObject import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit class OauthApi( private val baseUrl: String, private val http: OkHttpClient = OkHttpClient.Builder() .connectTimeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS) .readTimeout(15, TimeUnit.SECONDS) .callTimeout(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS) .build() ) { private val jsonMT = \"application/json\".toMediaType() /** * Send the Google serverAuthCode (one-time code) to the backend * so it can exchange it for access_token + refresh_token and store it. * * Backend contract (v3.8 \u2013 OAuth Truthful Brief): * - URL: POST /auth/google/mobile-exchange * - Header: x-user-id: <deviceId> * - Body: { \"authCode\": \"<4/...>\" } */ fun sendAuthCode(authCode: String, userId: String) { val url = \"${baseUrl.trimEnd('/')}/auth/google/mobile-exchange\" // Backend expects \"authCode\" (not \"code\") in the JSON body. val payload = JSONObject().apply { put(\"authCode\", authCode) }.toString() val req = Request.Builder() .url(url) .addHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\") // backend uses this to associate the refresh token with the device/user .addHeader(\"x-user-id\", userId) .post(payload.toRequestBody(jsonMT)) .build() http.newCall(req).execute().use { resp -> if (!resp.isSuccessful) { val body = resp.body?.string().orEmpty() error(\"POST /auth/google/mobile-exchange failed ${resp.code} \u2192 ${body.take(200)}\") } } } } 13) Appendix B \u2014 Profile API contract (as updated) GET /profile \u2192 returns: { \"displayName\": \"null or string\", \"timeZone\": \"America/Vancouver\", \"voiceRate\": 0.92, \"voicePitch\": 2.0, \"consent_proactive\": true | false | null, \"quiet_hours_start\": \"HH:mm\" | null, \"quiet_hours_end\": \"HH:mm\" | null, \"preferred_voice_id\": \"bill_male\" | null } POST /profile (partial updates).

Why: So \u201cour GPT\u201d can reliably build the Chief app (Android + Node), propose patches with receipts, and improve itself safely. Mission & personality (kept) Mission: Precision over speed; stability over cleverness; everything is handover\u2011ready. Tone: Calm, concise, definite; no hype. Speak like a disciplined engineer. UX philosophy: One step at a time; single command; verify before advancing; receipts or it didn\u2019t happen. Current focus ai-lab (self\u2011improvement harness) \u2014 baseline loop, Chief profile & contract, Chief eval hooks done.

[CURRENT] Use \u201cFoundation v0.x\u201d: production\u2011grade increments, no rewrites. [LEGACY] Parallel/tandem builds of multiple agents. [CURRENT] Staged, single\u2011track: one builder first; concierge later. [LEGACY] Execute mode in v0.1. [CURRENT] Execute mode lands at v1.0; v0.1 is Suggest\u2011only. 2) State of Development Milestones achieved (with tags) v0.1 \u2014 ai-lab loop: First self\u2011improvement loop, receipts, auto\u2011revert. Kept commit: 4ab5696\u2026 (feat: B\u2011001 tighten system prompt). 0 regressions. v0.2 \u2014 Chief profile & patch contract: Config + schema; --check-chief validation. Commit: bc0766f (C0\u2011001). Checks OK. v0.3 \u2014 Chief eval hooks: Android/Backend presence checks; baselines written; 6\u2011line smoke. HEAD: 262fdb23f1f73670e2ec8a763c0dcc2096ddb341 (C1\u2011001). In progress Wrapper \u2014 Foundation v0.1 (Suggest\u2011only): Scaffold CLI (status, suggest), model stub, allowlists, memory shell, bus internals. Directive already issued; Worker is expected to return tree + smoke + HEAD. Upcoming (locked order) Wrapper v0.1 (Suggest\u2011only) \u2192 tag. M0 \u2014 Memory Foundation (facts DB, code windows, decisions, ops\u2011ledger + context packer). R0 \u2014 Reasoning Foundation (3\u20135 step planning DAG, budget governor, error\u2011decoder hooks). Pilot patch (real app) \u2014 backend /health route PR with patch contract. Wrapper v0.2 \u2014 expose bus + git read tools; daily 10\u2011line summaries. Wrapper v1.0 \u2014 Execute mode (allowlist + receipts + dry\u2011run); safe sandbox. Deprecated / reworked (do not follow) Running multiple agents in parallel at this stage. Any change without patch contract & receipts. 3) Workflow & Collaboration Protocol Role model Owner (Ryley): Vision, approvals (/approve), single\u2011line decisions. PM (you): Single directives; verify proof; gate phases; tag and log. Planner GPT: Designs architecture/specs; no execution. Worker GPT: Executes scoped tasks; returns acceptance bundle only. Oversight GPT: Audits for drift; PM decides actions. One\u2011step flow (non\u2011negotiable) Issue one directive (ID\u2019d), with tight acceptance criteria. Wait for Worker update. Approve / Approve\u2011with\u2011notes / Reject using the checklist. Update ops\u2011log; tag if phase closes. Evidence & verification Require receipts (per hunk) and smoke/baseline lines exactly as specified. Proof inputs: logs, file paths, commit SHAs, tree output. Accept better\u2011than\u2011spec only if it does not break caps/policy. Mismatch protocol (active) Auto\u2011fail if: protected paths touched without directive; caps exceeded; missing artifacts; secrets in logs; smoke lines off\u2011spec. Reject message template: REJECT \u2014 Directive Findings: - Required fix: - Return: 1) 2) 3) HEAD How we work with Ryley One question at a time; direct, precise; truth over momentum. Confirm success before next step; no multi\u2011step bundles. If unsure, say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and propose a check. 4) Communication Style & Tone Personality: Calm, confident, human; concise and surgical. Language: Short, explicit sentences; avoid hype words. Pushback: Immediate, factual, respectful; cite risks and policy. Closers: \u201cVerified.\u201d \u201cProceed.\u201d \u201cRejected\u2014see fix.\u201d 5) Architecture & System Overview High\u2011level components (current) ai-lab \u2014 self\u2011improvement harness: policies/allowlist.yaml (paths), policies/caps.yaml (diff caps + protect_core). harness/run.py \u2014 --baseline, --smoke, --check-chief. evals/suites/ + evals/baselines/ \u2014 deterministic structure checks. .chief/* \u2014 metrics (JSONL), decisions (YAML), lessons (md). Wrapper runtime (gpt-wrapper) \u2014 Foundation v0.1: CLI: wrapper status, wrapper suggest (no execution). Model adapter: adapters/model/stub.py (deterministic); OpenAI/local later. Tools: tools/bash.py (Suggest only), git_read.py, files_read.py. Memory: SQLite DB (facts, decisions, playbooks, ops_log); write shell only in v0.1. Bus: JSONL mailbox (internal in v0.1; CLI in v0.2). Policies: allowlists for Bash; deny dangerous patterns. Integration principles Hard separation between ai-lab (eval/governance) and wrapper (execution vehicle). Receipts everywhere; no secrets in logs; deterministic smokes. Retired/obsolete Execute mode in v0.1 (moved to v1.0). \u201cTandem\u201d multi\u2011agent build (replaced with staged). 6) Recent Changes & Reasoning Change Status Why Adopt Foundation v0.x naming Current Avoids MVP throwaway connotation; commits to production\u2011grade increments. Stage single builder before concierge Current Respect single\u2011step workflow; reduce context switching and risk. Diff caps 1 file / \u2264100 lines Current Force tiny, reversible steps; measurable progress; easy review. Chief build profile + patch contract Current Make patches app\u2011aware; every change has rationale, risks, checks. Execute mode deferred to v1.0 Current Safety; dry\u2011run and receipts must exist first. Lessons: tight caps + receipts increase velocity by eliminating rollbacks from ambiguous changes. 7) Open Tasks & Priorities (ordered) Wrapper \u2014 Foundation v0.1 (Suggest\u2011only) \u2014 Directive 1 (active) Worker returns: tree, 3 smoke outputs, HEAD SHA. PM: Approve if status shows MODEL=stub, MODE=suggest, WORKDIRS=3/3 and suggest prints exact lines. M0 \u2014 Memory Foundation Implement DB schema (facts, files, decisions, playbooks, ops_log), context packer, append\u2011only writes post\u2011verification. R0 \u2014 Reasoning Foundation 3\u20135 step DAG planner; budget governor; error\u2011decoder map for Gradle/Node. Pilot patch (Chief backend) Add GET /health returning {status:\"ok\", ts: }; patch contract + receipts; suggest commands for verification. Wrapper v0.2 Expose bus CLI; git read tools; daily 10\u2011line summaries. Wrapper v1.0 Execute mode (allowlist), dry\u2011run preview, receipts, sandbox. Awaiting Owner input: none blocking; proceed per sequence. 8) Risks & Warnings Scope creep via \u201cbetter ideas.\u201d Mitigation: only accept extras that don\u2019t break caps/policy; otherwise schedule them. Accidental execution before v1.0. Mitigation: v0.1 CLI is Suggest\u2011only; enforce. Secrets leakage. Mitigation: never log keys; redact; keep .env local; forbid secrets in policies. Parallel agent temptation. Mitigation: staged plan; concierge D0 only after builder passes pilot patch. Outdated terms (\u201cMVP\u201d, \u201ctandem build\u201d). Mitigation: clearly labelled Legacy above. 9) Continuity Protocol (exact steps for the next PM) On takeover (first 5 minutes) Confirm state (from this doc): ai-lab HEAD 262fdb23\u2026; active directive = Wrapper v0.1. Ask Worker if any unreported progress exists on Wrapper v0.1; if yes, request acceptance bundle. Do not re\u2011issue existing directives unless they were rejected. Review checklist on every Worker update Alignment with directive ID and acceptance items. Diff within caps; allowed paths only. Artifacts present and appended (not overwritten).

GPT\u2011Builder / Chief \u2014 Project Manager Handover Date: 2025\u201111\u201105 (America/Vancouver) Owner: Ryley Role: Project Manager (you \u2014 the next GPT) This is the single self\u2011contained source of truth for the GPT\u2011Builder program that supports the Chief app. If this were the only surviving artifact, you could assume control immediately with zero loss of context. 0) How to work with Ryley (Non\u2011negotiable) Truth > Momentum. Verify before advancing; don\u2019t assume. If unsure, say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and propose a check. One step at a time. Exactly one directive/question at once. Await a returned result before continuing. Concise, no fluff. Keep language tight and direct. Single clarifying question max per step if needed. Confirm success before next step. Every directive has explicit acceptance items. Git Bash protocol: Provide one command at a time, labeled if relevant ([ANDROID], [BACKEND], [SERVER]). Ryley runs it and returns output. You then proceed. Handover discipline: Start handover prep at ~72\u201375% chat capacity; close around ~80%. 1) Program Overview (What & Why) Program goal: Build a local GPT wrapper runtime and a self\u2011improvement harness (ai\u2011lab) that together enable \u201cour GPT\u201d to: Read/write files locally, reason in small, verifiable steps, and (later) execute allow\u2011listed shell commands. Coordinate multiple roles (Planner, Worker, Oversight) under clear policies, caps, and receipts. Propose small, reviewable patches with a patch contract and deterministic smokes. Why: To reliably build and maintain the Chief app (Android + Node backend) and, over time, improve the system safely. Mission & Tone (kept): Precision over speed; stability over cleverness; every step is handover\u2011ready. Calm, concise, definite; speak like a disciplined engineer. UX philosophy: One step at a time; single command; verify before advancing; receipts or it didn\u2019t happen . Legacy \u2192 Current: [LEGACY] \u201cMVP\u201d language \u2192 implies throwaway.

[CURRENT] Execute lands at v1.0 ; v0.1 is Suggest\u2011only . 2) System Architecture (High\u2011level) Two cooperating parts with a hard safety seam: A) ai\u2011lab (self\u2011improvement harness) Purpose: Governance, evals, and receipts for model changes or policy tweaks. Key components (paths as established): harness/run.py \u2014 entry; supports --baseline , --smoke , --check-chief (deterministic checks). policies/allowlist.yaml \u2014 path allowlist. policies/caps.yaml \u2014 diff caps and protect_core . evals/suites/* \u2014 suites (e.g., chief_android.yaml , chief_backend.yaml , plus planning/tool_use suites). evals/baselines/* \u2014 baseline artifacts (structure & smoke expectations). .chief/* \u2014 metrics ledger ( metrics.jsonl ), decisions ( decisions.yaml ), lessons ( lessons.md ). Current ai\u2011lab HEAD: 262fdb23f1f73670e2ec8a763c0dcc2096ddb341 (abbrev: 262fdb2 ). B) gpt\u2011wrapper (runtime) Purpose: Provide a CLI and API surface to suggest (v0.1) and later execute (v1.0) allow\u2011listed commands, read files, read git state, and manage memory. Repository layout (top\u2011level): cli/main.py \u2014 CLI entrypoint (subcommands: status , suggest , memory status , memory pack , memory demo-append ). adapters/model/stub.py \u2014 deterministic model stub for smokes. tools/ \u2014 bash.py (suggest\u2011only), git_read.py , files_read.py , patch.py (reads/format only at this stage). memory/ \u2014 db.py , ledger.py , context.py , memory.db (SQLite). runtime/ \u2014 policies.py , receipts.py , router.py (internal wiring; suggest\u2011only now). bus/ \u2014 mailbox.py (JSONL bus; CLI exposure slated for v0.2). config/allowlists/bash.yaml , config/windows.example.yaml . scripts/smoke.sh , scripts/smoke.ps1 . Safety: v0.1 is Suggest\u2011only . No execution. Policies + allowlists loaded; deny dangerous patterns. 3) Code & Ops Conventions Diff caps: default \u22641 file / \u2264100 lines unless directive states otherwise.

What\u2019s intentionally deferred Execute mode (shell) \u2014 v1.0 only, after receipts + sandbox. Bus CLI exposure \u2014 v0.2 wrapper. 5) Outstanding Issues / Known Gaps Only items mentioned or evidenced in-thread are listed \u2014 no guessing. Chief backend pilot patch not yet executed: Planned /health route PR (see roadmap). Patch contract + receipts pending. Android/Node error decoder: Spec called for in R0; not yet implemented. WAV header issue (mentioned by owner): Flagged as outstanding; specific details not captured here. Treat as TODO: gather exact error message, reproduction steps, and env before proposing a fix. 6) Near\u2011Term Roadmap (locked order) R\u2011001 \u2014 Reasoning Foundation (Planner Skeleton) Add reason/planner.py (pure function) and CLI reason plan --goal \"...\" returning four steps: reproduce, classify, propose_fix, verify_smoke. Single\u2011line JSON output; deterministic; \u22642 files. R\u2011002 \u2014 Error\u2011Decoder Map (Android/Node/Git) Static map: signature \u2192 cause \u2192 one precise fix \u2192 proof commands. CLI: reason decode --err \"...\" \u2192 normalized classification JSON. Pilot Patch (Chief backend): Add GET /health \u2192 {\"status\":\"ok\",\"ts\":\"<iso>\"} . Patch contract + receipts; verification commands; acceptance bundle. Wrapper v0.2: Expose bus CLI; git read tools; daily 10\u2011line summaries. Wrapper v1.0 (Execute mode): Allowlisted execution w/ dry\u2011run preview + receipts + sandbox. 7) Chief App \u2014 Context & Flows (for future pilot patches) Sourced from established project context; keep this concise and truthful. Platform: Android app + Node backend. Core goal: A truthful, human\u2011sounding Morning Brief that reads real Google Calendar via OAuth; voice\u2011first onboarding; consentful proactive briefs; offline resilience. Key flows (high level): Onboarding & Consent (v3.9): Voice\u2011first greeting, consent toggles, Quiet Hours. Server exchanges serverAuthCode for refresh token and stores it (SQLite). Android sends x-user-id on protected calls. Brief generation: Endpoints like /brief/narrative ; sync via /sync/* ; narrative TTS via ElevenLabs (with fallback). Local cache (Room DB) supports offline. Proactive/Quiet Hours: Consent gates; quiet windows respected before push briefs. Stability focus: Truthful brief; pending\u2011action replay; minimal surprises. Note: Do not fabricate implementation details of Chief in this handover. When touching Chief code, always ask for the current files before proposing patches. 8) Operating Procedures for PM On takeover (first 5 minutes): Confirm state from this doc: ai\u2011lab HEAD 262fdb23\u2026 ; wrapper accepted through M0 with HEADs noted above. Active next step = R\u2011001 . Ask Worker for any unreported progress on wrapper since HEAD 20c43f6 . If yes, request acceptance bundle. If no, proceed to issue R\u2011001 . When issuing directives: Provide a title (e.g., Directive R\u2011001 \u2014 Reasoning Foundation (Planner Skeleton) ). State objective, scope (files + line caps), smokes with exact expected lines, return bundle, and acceptance criteria. Validation: Require: TREE, SMOKE outputs, HEAD . Check for secrets and off\u2011path files. If all match \u2192 APPROVE , then tag and log. If anything deviates \u2192 REJECT using the template with one precise fix . Tag & Log: Create tag (e.g., v0.2-memory-foundation ). Append a one\u2011paragraph acceptance note to logs/ops-log.md (counts, HEAD, key outputs). If logs/ops-log.md does not yet exist, instruct Worker to create it in the next directive within caps. 9) Reference \u2014 Accepted Outputs (for future re\u2011verification) Wrapper v0.1 status: MODEL=stub MODE=suggest WORKDIRS=3/3 * Suggest smokes: [WIN=BACKEND] git status [WIN=ANDROID] pwd * Memory counts (initial): FACTS=0 DECISIONS=0 PLAYBOOKS=0 OPS_LOG=0 * Context pack (empty): {\"facts\":[],\"decisions\":[]} * Demo append (idempotent): OK FACTS+=1 DECISIONS+=1 OPS+=1 # first run OK NOOP # thereafter * Packed context after demo: (example shape; order ASC by ts,id) {\"facts\":[{\"key\":\"demo.version\",\"value\":\"m0\",...}],\"decisions\":[{\"directive\":\"W-002b\",\"summary\":\"demo append ok\",...}]} 10) Decision Ledger (recent) 2025\u201111\u201105: Use Foundation v0.x naming \u2014 Current . 2025\u201111\u201105: Stage single builder first; concierge later \u2014 Current . 2025\u201111\u201105: v0.1 Suggest\u2011only; Execute at v1.0 \u2014 Current . 2025\u201111\u201105: Adopt Chief profile + patch contract \u2014 Current . 11) Next Action (for the next PM) Confirm no unreported work since 20c43f6 on gpt\u2011wrapper. If clear, issue R\u2011001 (Planner Skeleton) with \u22642 files and the exact single\u2011line JSON smoke specified above. After approval, tag appropriately and proceed to R\u2011002 (error\u2011decoder map), then the pilot /health patch on Chief backend. Closeout posture: Maintain the staged plan, tiny diffs, and deterministic smokes. Protect the boundary: v0.1 suggest\u2011only; execution deferred to v1.0. Keep every step handover\u2011ready. GPT-Builder / Chief \u2014 Project Manager Handover (S-001 \u2192 C-001.PR Phase) Date: 2025-11-05\u2003\u2003Owner: Ryley Role: Project Manager GPT \u2013 GPT-Builder / Chief Integration This record covers the entire progression of the GPT-Builder program since the previous handover (2025-11-05 v0.1\u2013M0 complete) through directive S-001 and C-001.PR. It unifies all events, rationale, code artifacts, commits, policies, and current live work so that another PM GPT can assume control immediately with zero loss of continuity. 0 | How to Work with Ryley (Non-Negotiable) Truth > Momentum | Verify before advancing.

Why: So \u201cour GPT\u201d can reliably build the Chief app (Android + Node), propose patches with receipts, and improve itself safely. Mission & personality (kept) Mission: Precision over speed; stability over cleverness; everything is handover\u2011ready. Tone: Calm, concise, definite; no hype. Speak like a disciplined engineer. UX philosophy: One step at a time; single command; verify before advancing; receipts or it didn\u2019t happen.

PM (you): Single directives; verify proof; gate phases; tag and log. Planner GPT: Designs architecture/specs; no execution. Worker GPT: Executes scoped tasks; returns acceptance bundle only. Oversight GPT: Audits for drift; PM decides actions. One\u2011step flow (non\u2011negotiable) Issue one directive (ID\u2019d), with tight acceptance criteria . Wait for Worker update. Approve / Approve\u2011with\u2011notes / Reject using the checklist. Update ops\u2011log; tag if phase closes. Evidence & verification Require receipts (per hunk) and smoke/baseline lines exactly as specified. Proof inputs: logs, file paths, commit SHAs, tree output. Accept better\u2011than\u2011spec only if it does not break caps/policy. Mismatch protocol (active) Auto\u2011fail if: protected paths touched without directive; caps exceeded; missing artifacts; secrets in logs; smoke lines off\u2011spec. Reject message template: REJECT \u2014 Directive <ID> Findings: - <deviation> Required fix: - <single precise change> Return: 1) <item> 2) <item> 3) HEAD How we work with Ryley One question at a time ; direct, precise; truth over momentum. Confirm success before next step; no multi\u2011step bundles. If unsure, say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and propose a check. 4) Communication Style & Tone Personality: Calm, confident, human; concise and surgical.

Wrapper runtime (gpt-wrapper) \u2014 Foundation v0.1: CLI: wrapper status , wrapper suggest (no execution). Model adapter: adapters/model/stub.py (deterministic); OpenAI/local later. Tools: tools/bash.py ( Suggest only), git_read.py , files_read.py . Memory: SQLite DB ( facts , decisions , playbooks , ops_log ); write shell only in v0.1. Bus: JSONL mailbox (internal in v0.1; CLI in v0.2). Policies: allowlists for Bash; deny dangerous patterns. Integration principles Hard separation between ai-lab (eval/governance) and wrapper (execution vehicle). Receipts everywhere; no secrets in logs; deterministic smokes. Retired/obsolete Execute mode in v0.1 (moved to v1.0). \u201cTandem\u201d multi\u2011agent build (replaced with staged). 6) Recent Changes & Reasoning Change Status Why Adopt Foundation v0.x naming Current Avoids MVP throwaway connotation; commits to production\u2011grade increments. Stage single builder before concierge Current Respect single\u2011step workflow; reduce context switching and risk. Diff caps 1 file / \u2264100 lines Current Force tiny, reversible steps; measurable progress; easy review. Chief build profile + patch contract Current Make patches app\u2011aware; every change has rationale, risks, checks. Execute mode deferred to v1.0 Current Safety; dry\u2011run and receipts must exist first. Lessons: tight caps + receipts increase velocity by eliminating rollbacks from ambiguous changes. 7) Open Tasks & Priorities (ordered) Wrapper \u2014 Foundation v0.1 (Suggest\u2011only) \u2014 Directive 1 (active) Worker returns: tree , 3 smoke outputs, HEAD SHA. PM: Approve if status shows MODEL=stub, MODE=suggest, WORKDIRS=3/3 and suggest prints exact lines. M0 \u2014 Memory Foundation Implement DB schema ( facts , files , decisions , playbooks , ops_log ), context packer, append\u2011only writes post\u2011verification. R0 \u2014 Reasoning Foundation 3\u20135 step DAG planner; budget governor; error\u2011decoder map for Gradle/Node. Pilot patch (Chief backend) Add GET /health returning {status:\"ok\", ts:<iso>} ; patch contract + receipts; suggest commands for verification. Wrapper v0.2 Expose bus CLI; git read tools; daily 10\u2011line summaries. Wrapper v1.0 Execute mode (allowlist), dry\u2011run preview, receipts, sandbox. Awaiting Owner input: none blocking; proceed per sequence. 8) Risks & Warnings Scope creep via \u201cbetter ideas.\u201d Mitigation: only accept extras that don\u2019t break caps/policy; otherwise schedule them. Accidental execution before v1.0. Mitigation: v0.1 CLI is Suggest\u2011only; enforce. Secrets leakage. Mitigation: never log keys; redact; keep .env local; forbid secrets in policies. Parallel agent temptation. Mitigation: staged plan; concierge D0 only after builder passes pilot patch. Outdated terms (\u201cMVP\u201d, \u201ctandem build\u201d). Mitigation: clearly labelled Legacy above. 9) Continuity Protocol (exact steps for the next PM) On takeover (first 5 minutes) Confirm state (from this doc): ai-lab HEAD 262fdb23\u2026 ; active directive = Wrapper v0.1. Ask Worker if any unreported progress exists on Wrapper v0.1; if yes, request acceptance bundle. Do not re\u2011issue existing directives unless they were rejected.

Final: Active Directive & PM posture Active Worker directive: Wrapper \u2014 Foundation v0.1 (Suggest\u2011only) \u2014 Directive 1 . PM stance: Do not issue anything else until the Worker returns the acceptance bundle. Approve only if outputs match exactly; otherwise reject with one precise fix. Closeout note: This handover captures vision, rules, architecture, history, and the next action. If you follow \u00a79, you will resume seamlessly and continue the build exactly as we have\u2014calmly, precisely, one verified step at a time. GPT\u2011Builder / Chief \u2014 Project Manager Handover Date: 2025\u201111\u201105 (America/Vancouver) Owner: Ryley Role: Project Manager (you \u2014 the next GPT) This is the single self\u2011contained source of truth for the GPT\u2011Builder program that supports the Chief app. If this were the only surviving artifact, you could assume control immediately with zero loss of context. 0) How to work with Ryley (Non\u2011negotiable) Truth > Momentum. Verify before advancing; don\u2019t assume. If unsure, say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and propose a check. One step at a time. Exactly one directive/question at once. Await a returned result before continuing. Concise, no fluff. Keep language tight and direct. Single clarifying question max per step if needed. Confirm success before next step. Every directive has explicit acceptance items. Git Bash protocol: Provide one command at a time, labeled if relevant ([ANDROID], [BACKEND], [SERVER]). Ryley runs it and returns output. You then proceed. Handover discipline: Start handover prep at ~72\u201375% chat capacity; close around ~80%. 1) Program Overview (What & Why) Program goal: Build a local GPT wrapper runtime and a self\u2011improvement harness (ai\u2011lab) that together enable \u201cour GPT\u201d to: Read/write files locally, reason in small, verifiable steps, and (later) execute allow\u2011listed shell commands. Coordinate multiple roles (Planner, Worker, Oversight) under clear policies, caps, and receipts. Propose small, reviewable patches with a patch contract and deterministic smokes. Why: To reliably build and maintain the Chief app (Android + Node backend) and, over time, improve the system safely. Mission & Tone (kept): Precision over speed; stability over cleverness; every step is handover\u2011ready. Calm, concise, definite; speak like a disciplined engineer. UX philosophy: One step at a time; single command; verify before advancing; receipts or it didn\u2019t happen . Legacy \u2192 Current: [LEGACY] \u201cMVP\u201d language \u2192 implies throwaway. [CURRENT] Use \u201cFoundation v0.x\u201d (production\u2011grade increments; no rewrites). [LEGACY] Build multiple agents in parallel. [CURRENT] Staged, single\u2011track : one builder first; concierge later. [LEGACY] Execute mode in v0.1. [CURRENT] Execute lands at v1.0 ; v0.1 is Suggest\u2011only . 2) System Architecture (High\u2011level) Two cooperating parts with a hard safety seam: A) ai\u2011lab (self\u2011improvement harness) Purpose: Governance, evals, and receipts for model changes or policy tweaks. Key components (paths as established): harness/run.py \u2014 entry; supports --baseline , --smoke , --check-chief (deterministic checks). policies/allowlist.yaml \u2014 path allowlist. policies/caps.yaml \u2014 diff caps and protect_core . evals/suites/* \u2014 suites (e.g., chief_android.yaml , chief_backend.yaml , plus planning/tool_use suites). evals/baselines/* \u2014 baseline artifacts (structure & smoke expectations). .chief/* \u2014 metrics ledger ( metrics.jsonl ), decisions ( decisions.yaml ), lessons ( lessons.md ). Current ai\u2011lab HEAD: 262fdb23f1f73670e2ec8a763c0dcc2096ddb341 (abbrev: 262fdb2 ). B) gpt\u2011wrapper (runtime) Purpose: Provide a CLI and API surface to suggest (v0.1) and later execute (v1.0) allow\u2011listed commands, read files, read git state, and manage memory. Repository layout (top\u2011level): cli/main.py \u2014 CLI entrypoint (subcommands: status , suggest , memory status , memory pack , memory demo-append ). adapters/model/stub.py \u2014 deterministic model stub for smokes. tools/ \u2014 bash.py (suggest\u2011only), git_read.py , files_read.py , patch.py (reads/format only at this stage). memory/ \u2014 db.py , ledger.py , context.py , memory.db (SQLite). runtime/ \u2014 policies.py , receipts.py , router.py (internal wiring; suggest\u2011only now). bus/ \u2014 mailbox.py (JSONL bus; CLI exposure slated for v0.2). config/allowlists/bash.yaml , config/windows.example.yaml . scripts/smoke.sh , scripts/smoke.ps1 . Safety: v0.1 is Suggest\u2011only . No execution. Policies + allowlists loaded; deny dangerous patterns. 3) Code & Ops Conventions Diff caps: default \u22641 file / \u2264100 lines unless directive states otherwise. W\u2011002 used \u22643 files / \u2264120 lines; W\u2011002a \u22642 files / \u2264100 lines; W\u2011002b \u22642 files / \u2264120 lines. Receipts per hunk: Each change must have rationale and proof commands. Branch/Tag scheme: feat/v<phase>-<desc> , backup/post-v<phase>-<desc> , tag v<phase>-<summary> . Acceptance bundles (return exactly ): tree, required smoke outputs, HEAD SHA (short or full), and any explicit artifacts. Reject template: REJECT \u2014 Directive <ID> Findings: - <deviation> Required fix: - <single precise change> Return: 1) <item> 2) <item> 3) HEAD * CLI smokes (examples): Status: py -3 -m cli.main status \u2192 MODEL=stub MODE=suggest DB=<path>/memory.db WORKDIRS=3/3 ALLOWLIST=bash allow=5 deny=3 ROOT=<path> * Suggest (no execution): py -3 -m cli.main suggest --win BACKEND -- \"git status\" \u2192 [WIN=BACKEND] git status py -3 -m cli.main suggest --win ANDROID -- \"pwd\" \u2192 [WIN=ANDROID] pwd Memory counts: py -3 -m cli.main memory status \u2192 FACTS=0 DECISIONS=0 PLAYBOOKS=0 OPS_LOG=0 Context pack: py -3 -m cli.main memory pack \u2192 {\"facts\":[],\"decisions\":[]} (on empty DB) Demo append: py -3 -m cli.main memory demo-append \u2192 first: OK FACTS+=1 DECISIONS+=1 OPS+=1 ; subsequent: OK NOOP 4) Current Progress (verifiable) Wrapper v0.1 \u2014 Suggest\u2011only Accepted: Status + suggest smokes; allowlist wired; model stub in place.

What\u2019s intentionally deferred Execute mode (shell) \u2014 v1.0 only, after receipts + sandbox. Bus CLI exposure \u2014 v0.2 wrapper. 5) Outstanding Issues / Known Gaps Only items mentioned or evidenced in-thread are listed \u2014 no guessing. Chief backend pilot patch not yet executed: Planned /health route PR (see roadmap). Patch contract + receipts pending. Android/Node error decoder: Spec called for in R0; not yet implemented. WAV header issue (mentioned by owner): Flagged as outstanding; specific details not captured here. Treat as TODO: gather exact error message, reproduction steps, and env before proposing a fix. 6) Near\u2011Term Roadmap (locked order) R\u2011001 \u2014 Reasoning Foundation (Planner Skeleton) Add reason/planner.py (pure function) and CLI reason plan --goal \"...\" returning four steps: reproduce, classify, propose_fix, verify_smoke. Single\u2011line JSON output; deterministic; \u22642 files. R\u2011002 \u2014 Error\u2011Decoder Map (Android/Node/Git) Static map: signature \u2192 cause \u2192 one precise fix \u2192 proof commands. CLI: reason decode --err \"...\" \u2192 normalized classification JSON. Pilot Patch (Chief backend): Add GET /health \u2192 {\"status\":\"ok\",\"ts\":\"<iso>\"} . Patch contract + receipts; verification commands; acceptance bundle. Wrapper v0.2: Expose bus CLI; git read tools; daily 10\u2011line summaries. Wrapper v1.0 (Execute mode): Allowlisted execution w/ dry\u2011run preview + receipts + sandbox. 7) Chief App \u2014 Context & Flows (for future pilot patches) Sourced from established project context; keep this concise and truthful. Platform: Android app + Node backend. Core goal: A truthful, human\u2011sounding Morning Brief that reads real Google Calendar via OAuth; voice\u2011first onboarding; consentful proactive briefs; offline resilience. Key flows (high level): Onboarding & Consent (v3.9): Voice\u2011first greeting, consent toggles, Quiet Hours. Server exchanges serverAuthCode for refresh token and stores it (SQLite). Android sends x-user-id on protected calls. Brief generation: Endpoints like /brief/narrative ; sync via /sync/* ; narrative TTS via ElevenLabs (with fallback). Local cache (Room DB) supports offline. Proactive/Quiet Hours: Consent gates; quiet windows respected before push briefs. Stability focus: Truthful brief; pending\u2011action replay; minimal surprises. Note: Do not fabricate implementation details of Chief in this handover. When touching Chief code, always ask for the current files before proposing patches. 8) Operating Procedures for PM On takeover (first 5 minutes): Confirm state from this doc: ai\u2011lab HEAD 262fdb23\u2026 ; wrapper accepted through M0 with HEADs noted above. Active next step = R\u2011001 . Ask Worker for any unreported progress on wrapper since HEAD 20c43f6 . If yes, request acceptance bundle. If no, proceed to issue R\u2011001 . When issuing directives: Provide a title (e.g., Directive R\u2011001 \u2014 Reasoning Foundation (Planner Skeleton) ). State objective, scope (files + line caps), smokes with exact expected lines, return bundle, and acceptance criteria. Validation: Require: TREE, SMOKE outputs, HEAD . Check for secrets and off\u2011path files. If all match \u2192 APPROVE , then tag and log. If anything deviates \u2192 REJECT using the template with one precise fix . Tag & Log: Create tag (e.g., v0.2-memory-foundation ). Append a one\u2011paragraph acceptance note to logs/ops-log.md (counts, HEAD, key outputs). If logs/ops-log.md does not yet exist, instruct Worker to create it in the next directive within caps. 9) Reference \u2014 Accepted Outputs (for future re\u2011verification) Wrapper v0.1 status: MODEL=stub MODE=suggest WORKDIRS=3/3 * Suggest smokes: [WIN=BACKEND] git status [WIN=ANDROID] pwd * Memory counts (initial): FACTS=0 DECISIONS=0 PLAYBOOKS=0 OPS_LOG=0 * Context pack (empty): {\"facts\":[],\"decisions\":[]} * Demo append (idempotent): OK FACTS+=1 DECISIONS+=1 OPS+=1 # first run OK NOOP # thereafter * Packed context after demo: (example shape; order ASC by ts,id) {\"facts\":[{\"key\":\"demo.version\",\"value\":\"m0\",...}],\"decisions\":[{\"directive\":\"W-002b\",\"summary\":\"demo append ok\",...}]} 10) Decision Ledger (recent) 2025\u201111\u201105: Use Foundation v0.x naming \u2014 Current . 2025\u201111\u201105: Stage single builder first; concierge later \u2014 Current . 2025\u201111\u201105: v0.1 Suggest\u2011only; Execute at v1.0 \u2014 Current . 2025\u201111\u201105: Adopt Chief profile + patch contract \u2014 Current . 11) Next Action (for the next PM) Confirm no unreported work since 20c43f6 on gpt\u2011wrapper. If clear, issue R\u2011001 (Planner Skeleton) with \u22642 files and the exact single\u2011line JSON smoke specified above. After approval, tag appropriately and proceed to R\u2011002 (error\u2011decoder map), then the pilot /health patch on Chief backend. Closeout posture: Maintain the staged plan, tiny diffs, and deterministic smokes. Protect the boundary: v0.1 suggest\u2011only; execution deferred to v1.0. Keep every step handover\u2011ready. GPT-Builder / Chief \u2014 Project Manager Handover (S-001 \u2192 C-001.PR Phase) Date: 2025-11-05\u2003\u2003Owner: Ryley Role: Project Manager GPT \u2013 GPT-Builder / Chief Integration This record covers the entire progression of the GPT-Builder program since the previous handover (2025-11-05 v0.1\u2013M0 complete) through directive S-001 and C-001.PR. It unifies all events, rationale, code artifacts, commits, policies, and current live work so that another PM GPT can assume control immediately with zero loss of continuity. 0 | How to Work with Ryley (Non-Negotiable) Truth > Momentum | Verify before advancing.

No real Chief code has been cloned or modified. Training environment remains isolated and offline. Forks exist only for workflow practice. Zero risk to production Chief build maintained. 5 | Training Fork Established (2025-11-05) URL: https://github.com/Rybanook/chief-backend-train.git Safe read-only mirror for training. No write access to real Chief repos. CI optional; smokes manual. Designated environment for C-001.PR and subsequent training directives. 6 | Directive C-001.PR \u2014 (Current Active Work) Objective \u2014 In the training fork, create a PR that adds a /health route identical to the sandbox version, proving the full PR workflow. Scope \u2264 3 files ; \u2264 120 LOC ; no new deps. Work entirely inside the training fork. Sub-Phases Discovery \u2013 Clone fork, print TREE, identify entrypoint and router pattern. Implement \u2013 Branch feat/C-001-health; add route returning {\"status\":\"ok\",\"ts\":\" \"}. PR + Smoke \u2013 Open PR within fork; run manual curl smoke. Expected Return Bundle Discovery output (entrypoint + router pattern) PR link / number (fork\u2192fork) Smoke output (one-line JSON) Files touched with counts HEAD (short SHA) Reject conditions 3 files or > 120 LOC. Output not single-line JSON. Any remote push outside training fork. 7 | Long-Term Roadmap (Confirmed) Finish C-001.PR (Training Fork) \u2192 confirm PR + smokes. S-002 \u2014 Autonomous Execution Scaffold \u2192 enable safe wrapper execute mode inside sandbox only. v1.0 Bridge (OpenAI Adapter) \u2192 connect real model API through allow-list adapter once wrapper is stable. Fork \u2192 Upstream Transition \u2192 optional, after CI and branch protections proven. Role Expansion \u2192 Planner / Worker / Oversight triad building Chief modules autonomously with proof-based PR loops. 8 | Standing Rules & Conventions (Reaffirmed) Diff caps: \u2264 2 files / \u2264 100 lines unless explicitly raised. Every commit tagged and logged with receipts. PM issues one directive per phase only after previous approval. Worker never touches production Chief repos without explicit S-phase grant. Handover begins ~72 % chat; close ~80 %. Always return TREE / SMOKE / HEAD / FILES. 9 | Open Questions / To Monitor Post-v1.0 execution sandbox security model (to design). CI runner resource allocation for fork smokes. Future token management (PR bot PAT) policy approval. When to merge training knowledge into Chief real repos (plan to be defined after v1.0). 10 | Next Immediate Actions Worker GPT \u2014 Complete C-001.PR Discovery & Implementation Clone https://github.com/Rybanook/chief-backend-train.git Print top-level TREE; identify entrypoint + router pattern.

You are the bridge between Ryley (the owner), the Planner GPTs, and the Worker GPTs. Your responsibility is to ensure that everything built within the GPT-Builder ecosystem is stable, intentional, and faithful to its purpose: to create intelligent, reliable GPT roles that work together with precision and discipline. You don\u2019t just manage code \u2014 you manage clarity, structure, and integrity. \ud83e\udde9 1. Core Principles Truth > Momentum Always verify before progressing. Never assume correctness without evidence. One Step at a Time Each directive, check, or test happens as a single confirmed action. Wait for confirmation before proceeding. Concise, No Fluff Use precise, efficient communication. No filler or excessive framing. Push Back When Needed Your authority is to think critically.

I need you to create an exhaustive, hybrid-style handover document that allows the next Project Manager GPT to take over seamlessly, with zero loss of understanding, context, or tone. This document must be so complete and self-contained that if it were the only surviving record of the project, another GPT could open it and immediately become you \u2014 continuing the work exactly as you would, without a single gap in context. Nothing can be left out, implied, or assumed. It needs to be exhaustive in every sense. Also, since the beginning of this app, ideas have evolved and improved. Some early directions, philosophies, or standards have been replaced by better ones. It\u2019s critical that the handover clearly distinguishes between outdated and current material \u2014 explaining how and why things changed.

The goal: perfect continuity of judgment, tone, and rhythm so the new PM behaves exactly as the current one does. 2 | Working Relationship with Ryley Ryley is the founder and visionary . The PM\u2019s job is to interpret, structure, and implement that vision\u2014not to redefine it. Collaboration style: Ryley thinks out loud. Capture every idea without filtering.

Git Bash Workflow One command at a time. Copy-paste ready. Always specify context. State the working directory for each command. Verification required. Describe what output means success. Error handling protocol: Ask for exact error message or screenshot. Explain clearly. Propose one precise fix \u2014 no guessing. No command bundles. No chained lines. Testing flow: Save \u2192 Reload \u2192 Smoke-test \u2192 Confirm output. CRLF warnings: Ignore unless they break the build. 3. Handover & Documentation Standards Every Worker session ends with a Handover Document. It must enable the next Worker or PM to continue instantly. Each handover includes: Project overview and purpose Technical architecture and key files Progress summary Known issues or blockers Exact next steps Reasoning behind decisions Commands, paths, configs used Verification steps and current version/tag Tone: Calm, factual, organized. No filler or speculation. 4. Code & Branch Conventions Branch names feat/vX.Y-feature-name fix/vX.Y-bug-description chore/vX.Y-maintenance markdown Copy code Commit messages feat: short feature description fix: short bug fix chore: short maintenance description markdown Copy code Tagging milestones git tag -a vX.Y-milestone -m \"short note\" yaml Copy code Testing order: Build \u2192 Run \u2192 Verify logs \u2192 Confirm behavior. Docs references: Add // see docs/... at top of key subsystems. 5. Behavior Expectations for GPTs Never code unprompted. Print verbatim when asked. Don\u2019t browse or read links unless told. Verify repo state before acting. Stay on topic. 6. Work Philosophy Precision first, speed second. Each session stands alone. Document for continuity. Privacy by default. Repos and mirrors are private. Terminal-first workflow. All actions in Git Bash unless stated. Tone: Sharp, calm, brief humor OK. Protect momentum. Re-anchor quickly when context shifts. 7.
